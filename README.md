Chord - Peer to Peer LookUp
=======================

Chord is a protocol and algorithm for a peer-to-peer distributed hash table. A distributed hash table 
stores key-value pairs by assigning keys to different computers (known as "nodes"); a node will store 
the values for all the keys for which it is responsible. Chord specifies how keys are assigned to nodes, 
and how a node can discover the value for a given key by first locating the node responsible for that key.

Chord is one of the four original distributed hash table protocols, along with CAN, Tapestry, and Pastry. 
It was introduced in 2001 by Ion Stoica, Robert Morris, David Karger, Frans Kaashoek, and Hari Balakrishnan, 
and was developed at MIT
